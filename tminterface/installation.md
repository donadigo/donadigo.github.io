## Installation

**First, download the latest version of the TMInterface installer:**
<form action="{{ site.url_tminterface_latest }}" style="margin-right: 20px;">
    <input type="submit" class="download-button button-cyan" value="Download the newest version"/>
</form>
<br>
*You can also [download the raw .zip installation files]({{ site.url_tminterface_latest_zip }}) to extract them yourself. It is however recommended to use the installer.*

### Installation for the Steam version
First, make sure to [apply the Steam TMNF Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448953593). After that, follow the the [standalone instructions](#installation-for-the-standalone-version). This fix makes sure your game is up to date. If you cannot locate where your game install is follow these instructions:<br>
1. Go to **Library**.
2. Right click on TrackMania Nations Forever/TrackMania United Forever in your games list.
3. Click **Properties**.
4. In the properties window, choose **Local files**.
5. Click "Browse".

**How can I check if I applied the fix properly?**
1. Click on TrackMania Nations Forever/TrackMania United Forever in your games list.
2. Click **Play**.
3. Choose **TrackMania Nations/United Forever Settings** from the popup window. Click **Play**.
4. The window title of the launcher should say "TrackMania Nations/United Forever **2.11.26**". If the title displays the version **2.11.16**, then you didn't apply the patch properly and TMInterface will not work.

### Installation for the standalone version
1. Launch the TMInterface installer. You may need to disable your antivirus and accept any prompts Windows shows.
2. Click **Next**.
3. Choose the directory in which you installed TrackMania previously. This is usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\TmNationsForever`.
Make sure that the folder you are choosing contains the `TmForever.exe` file.
4. Click **Next** to install TMInterface.
5. Click **Finish** to finish the installation.
