## Working with triggers
Triggers are a part of the builtin TMInterface bruteforce script that allow you to optimize a section of a track that does not consist of a checkpoint or a finish. A trigger is a cube placed somewhere on the map that acts as a point of an evaluation for the script. If the car enters the trigger, the state of the car is evaluated and the bruteforce script can accept a new solution, based on this evaluation.

Currently, only position based evaluation is supported within TMInterface.

### How do I place a trigger on the map for bruteforce to evaluate?
